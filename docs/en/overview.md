## **What is TOGAF Architecture?**

TOGAF Architecture is a framework that helps organizations create business goals and establish an architecture-specific design while ensuring it aligns with those goals. It is an architectural methodology that adopts a systemic approach to reducing errors, keeping timelines, and growing according to stipulated budgets. The TOGAF method was developed in 1995 by The Open Group, and it is free to use for organizations who want it for personal reasons. It is not free for commercial purposes, and over 71 accredited TOGAF courses are available worldwide, along with eight certified tools.

According to the Open Group, the tenth edition of TOGAF architecture is slated to assist organizations in operating more efficiently, provide simpler navigation, and flawless guidance in implementing the TOGAF framework to suit their business use cases.

## **The Components of TOGAF Architecture**

The core TOGAF components are:

- Reference models
- Enterprise Continuum
- Architecture Content Framework
- Architecture Capability Framework
- ADM Guidelines and techniques
- Architecture Development Method (ADM)

## **TOGAF – a Standard Framework for Continuous Architecture Development**

[TOGAF training and certification](https://www.knowledgehut.com/it-service-management/togaf-prep-course) programs are designed to introduce professionals to the standard framework for continuous architecture development. Here is what you need to know.

### **What Do Its Elements Represent?**

TOGAF elements represent methods and tools for implementing frameworks for organizations, performing production and maintenance, and accepting changes done on process models. Many [IT service management courses](https://www.knowledgehut.com/it-service-management) go into the basics of these elements as part of the TOGAF learning process.

### **When Would You Use TOGAF?**

TOGAF is used when an organization hasn’t decided on its project requirements, scope, and needs, to identify these requirements to help organize various processes.

## **What Are Enterprise Architecture Principles?**

The general principles of TOGAF architecture design are:

- The architecture is limited to services that only the organization specifies.
- Architecture may use one or multiple services and even parts of a service.
- Formal IT governance implementations are recommended for the architecture to follow.
- All elements of the architecture should be reused in alignment with all categories of the Enterprise Continuum and not left out.

One of the prerequisites of using the [TOGAF ADM](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/it-service-management/togaf-adm) is designing it to meet organizational requirements and modify it accordingly. One of the primary tasks is to review the ADM and make sure it connects with other processes such as business strategy, development planning, budget, requirements, project management, and procurement. Generic architecture is referred to as Product Line Architecture and is analogous.

### **How Many Architecture Principles Does an Enterprise Need?**

An enterprise only needs four of the major TOGAF domains. There are 21 principles out there, and not all are required.

## **What is a TOGAF Architecture Roadmap?**

A TOGAF Architecture roadmap is a set of architectural elements and building processes that help an organization eventually shift from its current architecture to its target architecture. It implements changes on an incremental basis, and the architecture building blocks come with sufficient documentation. Roadmaps may be synchronized with major project plans, and their role is to produce results while ascertaining the level of detail needed to achieve them during the planning stages.

## **What is the TOGAF Architecture Development Method?**

The TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM) is a part of the TOGAF model and works in conjunction with the TOGAF Foundation Architecture. TOGAF ADM describes the process of transitioning from a TOGAF-specific architecture to one that is organization-specific and suits changing business requirements. Different building blocks, architectural components, and models are used, all of which relate to various domains of the TOGAF architecture. The ADM method is an iterative process, and its primary focus is to make architectural components ready for reuse and populate the company’s [Enterprise Continuum](http://www.opengroup.org/public/arch/p3/ec/ec_ec.htm).

The initial execution of ADM is the hardest, and organizations find that once they identify assets and structure processes, the model becomes readily available for implementation, application, and reuse.

## **The Stages of the TOGAF Architecture Development Method (TOGAF ADM)**

Following are the stages of the TOGAF ADM framework:

### **1\. Preliminary Phase**

The preliminary phase is used to identify business requirements, growth drivers, and key principles. The goal is to get a clear vision of what the company is aiming for and design architecture around that. It is the blueprint or the very foundation, and this phase is also used for selecting the best tools, architectural processes, API integrations, and more.

### **2\. Architecture Vision**

Architecture vision elaborates on the proposed enterprise architecture plan. This phase discusses initiation activities, business readiness, risks, and mitigation methods. Large and complex organizations can reduce the complexity of their operational processes and talk about relevant changes during this phase.

### **3\. Business Architecture**

Business architecture designs the architecture for enterprises on three levels - business, information systems, and technology. This phase develops the baseline for new architecture and selects architecture viewpoints for the stakeholder to review. It also defines the target architecture and analyzes gaps between baseline and target. Other non-functional criteria are looked into, and a detailed gap analysis report is drafted. Also,

### **4\. Information Systems Architecture**

Information Systems Architecture is divided into data and applications architecture. [Data architecture](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/it-service-management/togaf-data-architectural-way) defines data types and sources, while applications architecture lists all processes required for providing the data and supporting businesses. Some of the key inputs to this phase are the Enterprise Continuum, Architecture Vision, Data Principles, Request for Architecture Work, Gap Analysis Results, and relevant technical requirements. Other outputs are baseline applications architecture, statement of architecture work, data architecture report, impact analysis, and updated business requirements.

### **5\. Technology Architecture**

The technology architecture phase lays the groundwork for implementing work and sets the standard for baseline technology architecture. It considers different architecture models, viewpoints, and reference tools and makes the services portfolio for architectural building blocks. Key outputs of this phase are Target Technology Architecture Vision, validation of technology principles, Statement of Architecture Work (updated), gap analysis report, and all viewpoints that address main stakeholder concerns.

### **6\. Opportunities and Solutions**

This phase identifies the key business drivers, brainstorms technical requirements, work pages and solutions, and any other gap analysis. It identifies strategic parameters for change and assesses the costs and benefits of building upcoming projects. It also analyzes building versus buying and reusing solutions for business purposes. Key inputs of the phase are Request for Architecture Work, Statement of Architecture Work, Target Data Architecture, Reusable Architecture, and Product Information. At the same time, outputs are the implementation and migration strategy, impact analysis documentation and high-level implementation planning.

### **7\. Migration Planning**

Migration planning assigns priority levels to projects and sorts them in the most appropriate order. It estimates resource requirements, performs [cost-benefit analysis](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/project-management/cost-benefit-analysis-approach-steps), and risk assessments, and produces proposed implementation roadmaps.

### **8\. Implementation Governance**

This phase involves all the rules and regulations that govern implementing new frameworks. It formulates recommendations and constructs architecture contracts. It also performs all the appropriate governance functions and ensures conformance. Key outputs are the architecture-compliant implemented system and impact analysis report.

### **9\. Architecture Change Management**

This stage establishes architectural changes to the [management process](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/project-management/management-process), provides continuous monitoring, and decides whether or not a new architecture cycle should be implemented.  It also monitors technology changes and arranges for meetings with the Architecture Board. The two key inputs to this phase are the Requests for Architecture Change due to technology changes, Requests for Architecture change due to business changes, and primary outputs are New Request for Architecture Work, changes to Architecture framework and principles, and architecture updates.

### **10\. Requirements Management**

The objective of the requirements management phase is to list business architecture requirements for the entire ADM lifecycle. It identifies enterprise requirements, identifies necessary documentation, sets baselines, and reviews gap analysis results. It can add, modify, or remove these requirements based on the organization's priorities and update the requirements repository. All the outputs for each ADM phase are used as key inputs for the Requirements management phase. Outputs are changed requirements and impact statements and include the final version of the full implications of all project requirements.
